#How to use
#Bring up the single-type UI using pbTypeMatchUI.
#The species-specific UI is called using pbSpeciesTypeMatchUI.
#It's up to you to choose where the player can access these UI. The Pok√©gear might be a good home for it.

#Controls
#Press the left/right arrows to move between pages.
#Press "Use" to bring up a list that you can scroll through to jump between types/species. By default, this would be C/Space/Enter.
#When you've got the list up, press A or S (or whatever you have bound to page up/down) to jump down or up quickly.
#Press "Back" to close the UI. By default, this would be X/Esc.

#Please let me know if there are any issues/questions either here or via Discord (ThatWelshOne_#3324). I'm always happy to help where I can.

#As always, thanks for reading!
