	* Chapter 0: Where it all began:
		* The story begins where the player and the player's brother (black) is heading on a space station called "Theta Space Station", this is where the things start up as usual as the game introduce its mechanics and features bit by bit, the player will go down to the first floor (landing bay), there... the player and the player's brother (black) will met, after some conversation, the player is tasked to tell the player's brother (black)'s girlfriend (stella) that the player and the player's Brother (black) is leaving out the place, 

		* after some time, they reached there destination (creseltia City), where the game represents it as a "gateway" of the 8 factions that holds the 8 crystal stone, the player's brother (black) goes outside and ask the player if the player could run to the pokemon center fater than the player's (black)(this is impossible to outrun cuz its meant that the his/shes(player)'s brother is faster, so it guaranteed that the player loss), when the player reached the pokemon center, black (the player's brother) introduce the new things in the pokemon center (such as manual spawn set, save point (only in higher difficulties) and etc.) after that, the player is task to go on the tournament center and participate the up coming tournament, but 8 badges (supposed to be 20 badges but due to the main dev's poor coding experience, its not possible for now) is need to enter one, and so the player is tasked (again) to go up on the city (where the crystal stones are kept) on the palace of Victoria (the queen of the all the sector and all the region) which is the castlelize empire's remote chamber (its a palace and a chamber, dont ask why), in there... the player meets its whole family (expect his dad due to run out of ideas) like; Zeta: the assist of the player's mom, Aurora: the player's mom, Kate: the players big sister, black: the player's brother, while the player is the youngest of them all, as there approach the palace, a group of unknown treat was scouting and reporting things, after that Zeta (the player's assistant) assist the player to go on the palace (i didnt mention that it was blizzarding lol) cuz its blizzard, after some time, the crystal keepers (the ones who keeps and controls the crystal stones) and the queen (victory: the pink crystal keeper) was making.... oh shit, there got under attacked by a "Team decimated" (the unknown treats, basically a more high tech, bloody, better version of team rocket), the bring a flash bomb (basically a flashbash granade but heavy and stronger) at the middle of the announcement room leaving everyone (including the keepers and the high-tier guards) blind temporary, affecting the player as well, after some time, the player waked up but the place changed differently... and suddenly the player encountered the firt ever member of team decimated (and a first battle as well), if the player loss, the player back on time as the crystal stone repeats it, if won, then the player's brother (black) come out to save you, because of the battle, the player's brother (black) path (where he came from) was blocked, making them finding a new way to get out, as palace collapses... the player (and its brother) manage to get out of the place leaving an emergency evacuate, in background... intercepter, battleships, and cruisers is scattered around and regional defences (theta, alpha, gamma corp) figths back, due to unexpected ambush, the place is captured by team decimated, going back to tha player, the player and its family is already reach the escape ship, as the ship is leaving, Kate noticed that mom is missing so they take a look and THEY DID, as aurora runs towards to the ship, but sadly got shot and a droped on the floor, the player tried to help but its brother (black) pulled the player cuz for not being safe to step back, as the Aurora is saying her last words and after that she got hit by a suicidal ship, making it impossible to recover her body, everyone went silent as the ships moves on, since the player is young, the player didnt understand what just happened

		* As the ship move on, one if the engine got shot, but thankfully the general defence took it down, but the ship that was heading to sector 8 (thetain faction's zone) is unstablely flying leaving the ships to go to sector 1 (galaxia faction's zone), this is where Chapter 0 ends and Chapter 1 begins
